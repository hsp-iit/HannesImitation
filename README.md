_HannesImitation_ is an imitation learning-based approach that trains a single grasping policy across diverse objects and environments. 
The learned policy is deployed on the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling control of wrist orientation and hand closure. The main contributions are
- _HannesImitationPolicy_: The novel application of Diffusion Policy to control a prosthetic hand equipped with and anthropomorphic wrist.
- _HannesImitationDataset_: A novel dataset for imitation learning with the Hannes prosthetic hand for grasping on unstructured scenarios.

### 🛠️ Installation
The _HannesImitation_ project builds on top of Diffusion Policy. To set up the environment and dependencies, please follow the installation instructions provided in the Diffusion Policy repository: [https://github.com/real-stanford/diffusion_policy](https://github.com/real-stanford/diffusion_policy).
